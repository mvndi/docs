## Loading

To load the cannon, first right click the cannon with gunpowder pouches. The cannon requires 3 in order to load anything else. <br/>
After loading the gunpowder, move to the front of the cannon and right click with a cannonball or a canister shot to load the desired projectile.
- Cannonball: Can penetrate up to four blocks deep. Instantly kills and passes through any enemy it runs into.
- Canister Shot: An anti-infantry projectile which acts like a shotgun. Does not damage blocks.


## Firing
Once the cannon is loaded, right click the back of the cannon with a flint and steel to fire. There is a 16 second cooldown before firing again.
